            'text': 'August (Aug.) is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days. It is named after the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar.\n\nAugust does not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years, but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years. August always ends on the same day of the week as November.\n\nThe Month \n\nThis month was first called Sextilis in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735\xa0BC with Romulus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700\xa0BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450\xa0BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.\n\nAugust is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month. The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September.\n\nAugust, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other.'
