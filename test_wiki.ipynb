      "{'id': '3686', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book', 'title': 'Book', 'text': 'A book is a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers. The sheets of paper are usually covered with a text, language and illustrations.  The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the scroll.  The change from scrolls to books began in the Roman Empire, and took many centuries to become complete.\\n\\nA writer of a book is called an author. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an illustrator. Books can have more than one author or illustrator.\\n\\nA book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts. That way a book is perhaps written by one author, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood without knowing the whole collection. Examples are the Iliad, Odyssey, Bible and Torah. All of them consist of a number of “books” in this sense of the word. Encyclopedias often have separate articles written by different people, and published as separate volumes. Each volume is a book.\\n\\nHardcover books have hard covers made of cardboard covered in cloth or leather and are usually sewn together. Paperback books have covers of stiff paper and are usually glued together. The words in books can be read aloud and recorded on tapes or compact discs. These are called \"audiobooks\".\\n\\nBooks can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore. People can make their own books and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside, like a diary, address book, or photo album. Most of the time, the word \"book\" means that the pages inside have words printed or written on them.\\n\\nSome books are written just for children, or for entertainment, while other books are for studying something in school such as math or history. Many books have photographs or drawings.\\n\\nContent of books \\nThere are two main kinds of book text: fiction and non-fiction.\\n\\nFiction \\n\\nThese books are novels, about stories that did not happen, and have been imagined by the author. Some books are based on real events from history, but the author has created imaginary characters or dialogue for the events.\\n\\nNon-fiction \\n\\nBooks of non-fiction are about true facts or things that have really happened. Some examples are dictionaries, cookbooks, textbooks for learning in school, or a biography (someone\\'s life story).\\n\\nHistorical \\n\\nBetween the written manuscript and the book lie several inventions. Manuscripts are hand-made, but books are now industrial products.\\n\\nManuscripts \\nA common type of manuscript was the scroll, which was a long sheet rolled up. The sheet could have been made of papyrus (made by the Egyptians, by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then hammering them together), or parchment or vellum (very thin animal skin, first used by the ancient Greeks), or paper (made from plant fibers, invented by the Chinese). Manuscripts of this kind lasted to the 16th century and beyond. Turning the manuscript into a book required several developments.\\n\\nThe codex \\nThe Romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers, to form a codex. This was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls, but was not yet a book as we understand it.\\n\\nPrinting \\nScrolls and codices were written and copied by hand. The Chinese invented woodblock printing, where shapes are carved out of a block of wood, then ink is applied to the carved side, and the block is pressed onto paper. This woodcut method was slow because the symbols and pictures were made by cutting away the surrounding wood.\\n\\nJohannes Gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing, the printing press, in the 15th century. This involved more than just a press, it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the machine process.\\n\\nInitially, the machines were slow, and needed a printer\\'s muscle to make them work. The Industrial Revolution brought steam power and later electrification.\\n\\nPaper and ink \\nPaper had been invented in China in the 8th century, but it was kept secret for a long time. In Europe hand-made paper was available from about 1450. It was cheaper than parchment but still expensive, and the early printing was a slow process. Therefore, books remained rare. In 1800 the first machines for making paper from wood pulp were invented. New kinds of inks were also invented for various purposes, and machines were driven by steam engines and later by electricity.\\n\\nThe common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines, and books became cheaper. At the same time, in America, Britain and continental Europe, more people learnt to read. So, in the 19th century, many ordinary people could afford to buy books and could actually read them. Also in the 19th century came public libraries, so poorer people could get access to the best books.\\n\\nBinding \\nPrinting was done on large sheets of paper, which were then folded, guillotined (cut) and sewn into the covers. Bookbinding and all the other processes have been done by machines since the 19th century.\\n\\nNow \\nToday some of the technologies have been changed, especially those involving illustration and typography. However, books look much the same as they did, with more illustration in color, but basically the same. That is because experience has shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading. Graphic design and typography are the practical arts used to make books attractive and useful to readers.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Author\\n Bible\\n Literature\\n Notebook\\n Page\\n Reading\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n WikiHow article on How to read a Book\\n Google Book Search (Beta)\\n Bestseller list of all times \\n\\nBasic English 850 words\\n \\nHistory of printing'}\n"

It comes from the English phrase \"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.\"\\n\\nBefore a computer can operate normally, it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer. \\n\\nDevices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives (normally a hard drive or Solid State Drive, but can be a floppy disk, flash drive or a CD). Some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over a network. Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the mobile phone network.  Boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all application software they own. There are also boot boards or boot add-in cards that are more permanent than boot cards.\\n\\nSome people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non-boot devices as data devices, although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these.\\n\\nOrigin\\nThe boot in boot device is the same as booting (or starting up).

Some also have spats or gaiters to keep water out.  Most have a very strong boot sole, the bottom part of a boot.\\n\\nTypes of boots \\n Rain boots (or rubber boots) are made from rubber or plastic. Rain boots protect a person\\'s feet from water and rain. People who work on fishing boats and farmers wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in chemical factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.\\n\\n Winter boots are boots that keep a person\\'s feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as Canada and Sweden wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as leather, fabric, or plastic. Winter boots are insulated with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people\\'s feet dry.\\n\\n Work boots (or \"construction boots\") are designed for people who work in construction or factory jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person\\'s toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person\\'s foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of steel in the sole to protect the foot from sharp nails. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.\\n\\n Fashion boots are boots that are worn for style than for protection. Usually the term is used for women\\'s boots. These kind of boots come in many heights, where the top ends at the ankle, the knee, or the thigh. The ones that are tall are usually closed by a zipper or can stretch for putting it on easily.

The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\\n\\nThe Month \\n\\nApril comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\\n\\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other\\'s last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\\n\\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\\n\\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\\n\\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\\n\\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\\n\\nApril in poetry \\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter.
